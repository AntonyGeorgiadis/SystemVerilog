Project bars// 

This program was the final project under the Integrated Circuit Subject, its a simple VGA protocol that visualize 3 bars with different colours and a button that the user can move up and down, this way the user can control the length of the bars.
This was then loaded into a Nexys A7-100T training FPG board to visualize it.
